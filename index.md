### UC Davis Class of 2018
### Computer Science Major

## Interests
I'm an undergraduate at UC Davis interested in high performance computing, systems level programming, and computer security.

## Work Experience

### Thinking Books: Software Engineering Intern (Jan 2018 - Present)
At Thinking Books, I'm working with Dr. Raju Pandey, Associate Professor Emeritus at UC Davis. My roles are:
* creating a C-level abstraction layer runtime framework and configuration protocol for server deployment, modeled after Node JS.
* Designing and implementing a distributed runtime system for mobile, web, and IOT
applications using Ankur, a next generation object-oriented programming language

### Fortanix: Software Engineering Intern (July 2017 - Sept 2017)
In the summer of 2017, I worked at Fortanix, a startup specializing in runtime encryption leveraging Intel SGX. 
* Monitored the life cycle of various API endpoints for company cloud security solutions
* Designed and implemented front end automation testing of key user flows
* Coded sample programs that performed encryption and decryption operations with
Fortanixâ€™s SDK for product documentation

### Tynker: Software Engineering and QA Intern (July 2015 - Sept 2016)
I spent 2 summers at Tynker, working on their flagship products that taught children how to code.
* Managed a group of four interns to develop JavaScript curriculum, games, and activities for
first time programmers using the Tynker Library
* Integrated API web services into the Tynker product, creating demos and documentation
for web service features
* Performed quality assurance on Tynker programming courses, drone, and
device-integrated mobile products

## Research
I'm currently working with Dr. Sam King, exploring the part that cryptography and computer vision play in securing credit card transactions on mobile devices.

## Classwork/Projects

### Parallel Programming
Since September 2017, I have been working on various parallel programming projects in ECS 158 (Parallel Architectures) and EEC 289Q (GPU Programming). I've used C frameworks such and implemented projects such as:
* reciprocal pair-matching on large data sets in OpenMP
* optimized rollmean algorithm in OpenMP
* optimized maximum burst algorithm in CUDA
* Kronecker Product in CUDA

### Operating Systems
In ECS 150 (Operating Systems), I worked on various system level programming projects in C:
* a simple shell Bthat supports background processes, piping, multiple arguments, I/O redirection, & CRUD for directories
* a user level thread library that allows the creation of new threads, provides a synchronization mechanism for threads to join other threads, and allows for interrupt-based preemptive scheduling
* semaphores and thread memory region protection
* a simple file system based on FAT, supporting up to 128 files in a single root directory

### Software Engineering
In ECS 160 (Software Engineering), I worked with a group of 10 other students to port the linux based game Warcraft 2 to a native OSX application - involving extensive collaboration, code reviews, and deep understanding of the source code. We also learned the Swift programming language and had to map specific C++ protocols to it, leveraging native mac graphics libraries for animation.

### Research In Computer Security
In ECS 235A (Research in Computer Security), I read and discussed many significant security specific research papers with my peers. Topics ranged from cryptography and systems security to machine learning based security. As a term project, I worked with two others on conducting research for mobile malware detection. We analyzed tradeoffs between static and dynamic analysis techniques for malware detection and proposed approaches for different scenarios.
